ACID
Atomicity: either all actions in a Xact happen or none happens
Consistency: if initial DB starts consistent, it ends up consistent
Isolation: if X aborts, other Xacts are not affected, as if aborted X never happens.
Durability: If X commits, its W(A) effect must persist, even in case of system crash

X can be incomplete for reasons: transactions can be aborted, or terminated unsuccessfully, by the DBMS as anomaly arises during execution. If transaction is aborted, automatically restarted and execute new. System might crash(power supply) while X in progress. A transaction may encounter unexpected situation(read an unexpeted data value or be unable to access some disk) and decide to abort. 
DMBS ensures atomicity by undoing the actions of incomplete transactions. To maintain this, the DBMS maintains a record(log), of all writes to database. Log is also used for the durability, if the system crashes before the changes made by a complete transactions are written to a disk, the log is used to remember and restore these changes when the system restarts.
