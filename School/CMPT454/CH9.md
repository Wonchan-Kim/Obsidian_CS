At top, we have primary storage which consists of cache and main memory providing very fast access to the data. Then comes the secondary storage, which consists of slower devices such as magnetic disks. Tertiary storage is the slowest class of storage devices, such as tapes. 

### 9.1.1 Magnetic disks
Disks support direct access to a desired location and are widely used for database applications. A DBMS provides seamless access to data on disk, applications need not worry about whether the data is in memory or disk.
