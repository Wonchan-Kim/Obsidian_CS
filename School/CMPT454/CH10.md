Tree indexes: binary search can be also costy

Pairs of the form <key, pointer> as index entries or just entries. Each index pages contains pointer more than the number of keys, each key serves as a separator for the contents of the pages pointed to by the pointer to its left and right. ![[Pasted image 20250911193016.png]]![[Pasted image 20250911193021.png]]
Index page is the minimum unit consisting index file. 
We can do a binary search of the index file to identify the page containing the first key value that satisfies the range selection and follow the pointer to the page containing the first data record with that key value. Then we can scan the file sequentially from that point to retrieve the other qualifying records. 

Entry in the index file will not contain every information contained in the page, likely to be much smaller than the size of a page, and only one such entry exists per page of the data file. Now the binary search on the index file is much faster than a binary search of the data file.

===Binary search still expensive!===

## ISAM - INDEX SEQUENTIAL ACCESS METHOD
![[Pasted image 20250911195529.png]]
ISAM structure is ===static===. Primary pages are pre-fixed. 
Each tree node is a disk page, and all the data resides in the leaf pages. 
This corresponds to an index that uses Alternative 1, using ![[Pasted image 20250911200147.png]]
It is also possible to create an index with Alternative 2 by storing the data records in the separate file and storing <key, rid> pairs in the leaf pages of the ISAM index. When the file is created, all leaf pages are allocated sequentially and sorted on the search key value. If Alternative 2 or 3 is used, the data records are created and sorted before allocating the leaf pages of the ISAM index. The non-leaf level pages are then allocated. If more pages than primary pages are allocated, allocation of additional pages are required. ![[Pasted image 20250911200758.png]]
