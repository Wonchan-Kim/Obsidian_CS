## Binary Search
Find the arbitrary value in the sorted list. 
1. Designate the range
2. Adjusting the range - Exclude the half of the entire list depending on the result

## Binary Search Example
Suppose the database is consisted as follows;

| username | password |
| -------- | -------- |
| admin    | P@ssword |
We can use the return value of the substr function used in SQL Injection.
Printable character used in the password ranges from 32~126(ASCII), check if the first of the password is bigger than 79 (median).

``` sql
mysql > select * from users where username='admin' and ascii(substr(password, 1, 1)) > 79;
```

| username | password |
| -------- | -------- |
| admin    | P@ssword |
1 row in set
The first byte of the password is P(80), so the returned value is true. Now we can check 80~126 range. Repeating the process would result in finding all the passwords.

## Bit Operation
ASCII can express the value from 0 ~ 127, indicating that it represents the character with 7 bits. Using this fact, we can compare each bit with 1, with 7 queries. 
MySQL provides the function bin to convert the number into bit. 

```sql
mysql> SELECT bin(ord('A'))
```

| bin(ord('A')) |     |
| ------------- | --- |
| 1000001       |     |
1 row in set
