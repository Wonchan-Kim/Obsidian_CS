using gs register, canary value is stored in [ebp - 0x8].


Hence, knowing 4 bytes of (ebp-0x8) is enough to solve the question. 

The main function starts with push ebp.
Since ebp is 4 byte register, doing ebp + 4 will give the return pointer.

in 32 bit, the protocol is to push arguments into the stack. Hence, looking at the print box function, ebp-0x88 is the box. 
With same appraoch, ebp-0x48 is the name.
